This project was done using Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this project was to create a Convulutional NN for detecting skin cancer. 
The PDF not labeled report is a progress report of where the project was after a week. The PDF labeled report is the final report for the project.
I managed to get to an 82% detection rate and then with further adjustments ran into issues with over fitting that I was not able to fully remedy.
